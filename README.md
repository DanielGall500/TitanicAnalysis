# Titanic Data Analysis 
###### This Data Was Taken From On-Board The Ship

----

This data analysis project will analyse data taken from the Titanic on the day it sank. 

It will define interesting patterns taken from different statistics such as the mean age of survivors and non-survivors.
These patterns will be streamed to a text file so they can be shown on github.
